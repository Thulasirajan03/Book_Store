1. Frontend Development (React)
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are the building blocks of web development. You need to know how to structure your web pages, style them, and add interactivity.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You will use React to create the components for your bookstore UI, such as a homepage, book details page, shopping cart, and checkout page.
JSX: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. You'll need to understand how to use JSX properly in React components.
React Router: For managing navigation between different pages of your application (e.g., Home, Book Details, Cart, Checkout, etc.).
State Management (useState, useEffect): React relies on hooks like useState and useEffect to manage local component states and side effects.
Axios or Fetch API: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to interact with your backend API (e.g., to fetch books, add to cart, etc.).

2. Backend Development (Node.js and Express)
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. You'll use Node.js to build the backend of your bookstore, handle requests, and interact with the database.
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js, which simplifies building APIs by providing useful features for routing, middleware, and HTTP request handling.
RESTful API Design: You'll need to understand how to design and implement RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books, users, orders, etc.
Authentication: If your bookstore has user accounts (for login, registration, and order tracking), you will need to implement authentication, typically with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Passport.js for managing user sessions.
Body-Parsing Middleware: Use middleware like express.json() and express.urlencoded() to parse incoming request data.

3. Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and retrieve data for your application (books, users, orders, etc.). You need to know how to set up a MongoDB database and use it to persist data.
Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a higher-level abstraction to interact with MongoDB. Mongoose helps with defining schemas for your data (e.g., book model, user model, etc.) and querying the database.
Basic Database Operations: Learn how to perform CRUD operations on your MongoDB collections (e.g., insert a new book, retrieve all books, update a book's information, delete a book, etc.).

4. Development Tools & Environment
Node.js & npm: Install Node.js (which comes with npm, the Node Package Manager) to manage your project dependencies.
Text Editor / IDE: A code editor like VS Code is recommended because it provides features like syntax highlighting, extensions, debugging, and more.
Postman: A tool for testing your backend APIs and ensuring that they are working as expected.
MongoDB Atlas: If you are using a cloud-based MongoDB service, sign up for MongoDB Atlas to create a cloud database cluster.
5. Deployment & Hosting
Heroku or Vercel (for hosting your app) - These platforms provide easy ways to deploy both your frontend (React app) and backend (Node/Express app).
MongoDB Atlas: As mentioned earlier, MongoDB Atlas can be used to host your MongoDB database in the cloud.
Environment Variables: Learn how to manage sensitive information (like API keys, database URIs, etc.) with environment variables in your deployment settings.

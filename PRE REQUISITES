To develop a full-stack Book Store App using React js, Node.js,Express js and MongoDB, there are several prerequisites you should consider. Here are the key prerequisites for developing such an application: 

Node.js and npm: Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), on your development machine. Node.js is required to run JavaScript on the server side. 

• Download: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

• Installation instructions:https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/


MongoDB: Set up a MongoDB database to store hotel and booking information. Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. 

• Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community  

• Installation instructions:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ 


Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. Install Express.js to handle server-side routing, middleware, and API development. 

• Installation: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following

   command: npm install express 


React js: React is a JavaScript library for building client-side applications. 

 And Creating Single Page Web-Appliaction


Getting Started

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.


Quik  Start

npm create vite@latest

cd my-app

npm install

npm run dev


If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.


Create a new React project: 

• Choose or create a directory where you want to set up your React project. 

• Open your terminal or command prompt. 

• Navigate to the selected directory using the cd command. 


• Create a new React project by running the following command: npx create-react-app your-app-name.Wait for the project to be created: 

• This command will generate the basic project structure and install the necessary dependencies 


Navigate into the project directory: 

• After the project creation is complete, navigate into the project directory by running the following command: cd your-app-name 


Start the development server: 

• To launch the development server and see your React app in the browser, run the following command:  npm run dev 

• The npm start  will compile your app and start the development server. 

• Open your web browser and navigate to https://localhost:5173 to see your React app. 


You have successfully set up React on your machine and created a new React project. You can now start building your app by modifying the generated project files in the src directory.


Please note that these instructions provide a basic setup for React. You can explore more ad- vanced configurations and features by referring to the official  React documentation: https://react.dev/

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Basic knowledge of HTML for creating the structure of your app, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity is essential. 


Database Connectivity: Use a MongoDB driver or an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library like Mongoose to connect your Node.js server with the MongoDB database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


Front-end Library: Utilize React  to build the user-facing part of the application, including products listings, booking forms, and user interfaces for the admin dashboard. 


Version Control: Use Git for version control, enabling collaboration and tracking changes throughout the development process. Platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket can host your repository. 

• Git: Download and installation instructions can be found at: https://git-scm.com/downloads  


Development Environment: Choose a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that suits your preferences, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm. 

• Visual Studio Code: Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

• Sublime Text: Download from

 https://www.sublimetext.com/download 

• WebStorm: Download from https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download
